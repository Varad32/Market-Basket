# Market-Basket

A market basket analysis would help understand the purchase behavior of customers. In a shopping cart, normally, there are several items as a combination depending on the preference of different customers. Knowing what items would come after particular items, shelf planners would have better ideas of what items should be put together. Also, retail managers would better understand what sorts of items should be stored in the warehouse to prevent insufficiency.
